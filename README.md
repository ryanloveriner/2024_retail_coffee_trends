[Here](https://github.com/ryanloveriner/2024_retail_coffee_trends/blob/main/2024%20Retail%20Visuals.pdf) is an overview of Iconik Coffee Roaster's 2024 retail coffee sales trends. It's part of an ongoing pricing strategy project designed to lessen the impact of tarrifs and improve sales in a tightening market with newly emerging competitors. Data was ETLed through Microsoft Excel and PostgreSQL by means of automated python scripts similar to [these](https://github.com/ryanloveriner/clover_to_postgresql_automators). Visualizations were produced with Power BI.
